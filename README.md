# Learning Python By Doing
I wanted to learn python by doing, because learning by doing is the best approach for learning anything. And hence, I asked ChatGPT to give me some projects from all levels to learn python efficiently. And this repository is all the code that I wrote on this journey. 
Happy Coding!!!
